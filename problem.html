          <h2 class="sideheading">The rise of microtrends</h2>
          <p>Globalisation and the advancements of technology have allowed countries across the world to be more connected. However, many of our clothes are now made in developing countries where the value of labour is cheaper as a result.</p>
          <br>
          
          <h3>Clothing use dropped by 36% between 2000 and 2015</h3>
          <br>

          <p>The average consumer now buys 60% more items of clothing than in 2000, but each garment is kept for half as long as consumers discard items more quickly. Social media has only helped to exacerbate the problem, as garments are deemed “trendy” for shorter periods of time, leading consumers to buy more and keep them for less.</p>

          <br>


          <br>

          <h2 class="sideheading">Environmental consequences</h2>
          <p>Polyester, a synthetic material, is used in 60% of garments today, and it is three times more carbon-intensive than cotton. It is also a leading contributor to plastic pollution in the oceans. Polyester fibres make up nearly three-quarters of microplastic pollution in the Arctic - these fibres are mostly thought to be released from textile manufacturing and household laundry.</p>

          <h3>Depletion of the Aral Sea</h3>
          <br>

          <p>The Aral Sea in Central Asia, formerly the fourth largest lake in the world with an area of 68,000 km², had been reduced to 10% of its original size by 1997. The drastic change was due to its water being used to grow a highly water intensive crop; cotton.</p>
