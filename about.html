      <p class="w">Our cause is speaking out against how damaging fast fashion is to the environment. Many of the garments we buy are discarded and end up in landfills, creating tonnes of waste. It is detrimental not just to the environment, but also to the workers in the industry.  -tina</p>

      <br>

      <p class="w">People should pay attention to fast fashion, because it's responsible for a big part of carbon emissions in todayâ€™s world. It is not sustainable, because consumers buy mass-market garments that are cheaply made and priced in order to keep up with current trends.  -aibibi</p>
