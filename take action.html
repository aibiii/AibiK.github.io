      <p>It may seem like it's hard to make a difference when it's mostly huge corporations that are responsible for the damage caused to the environmental, but it's important that individuals take part too.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p>Things you can do include buying from sustainable companies, thrifting and choosing to buy clothing made of natural, better quality fabrics which will have a longer lifespan.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p>You do not have to completely stop buying fast fashion to help the cause, simply being aware and mindful when buying more is a good start. Together we can pressure governments to enforce regulations that would protect human rights and ensure that factory workers get a fair living wage.</p>
